# RadialDrag

## Summary
RadialDrag is a SwiftUI demo for iOS showing how to select one of eight points with a drag gesture originating in a circle. It can be expanded into a radial menu system.

Start a drag gesture from the center of the circle and after a minimum distance, a slice of the circle will light up and the selected position will be displayed. Haptics are used to indicate when a different selection is made if the drag gesture continues to move around the circle. Dragging back to the center of the circle will reset the selection.
